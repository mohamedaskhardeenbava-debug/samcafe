/**
 * QuickLinksFab — "…" floating trigger shown on the Food Category page
 * only. Popping open reveals 4 shortcut items (Crowd Picks, Combo,
 * Offers, Events & Bookings) along a CURVED quarter-circle arc to the
 * upper-left of the trigger button — 90° (straight up) through 180°
 * (straight left) — while still keeping each item's height a fixed,
 * EQUAL step above the one before it (item 0 the lowest, item 3 the
 * highest). Each item pops outward from the trigger's own position,
 * same pop-in-place idea as the Uiverse tooltip reference (icon in
 * the middle, related items blossoming out around it).
 *
 * Each item is its own name, rendered directly as the clickable pill
 * (.quick-links-item-label) — no separate icon/circle element. That
 * label's RIGHT edge is what sits at its own (tx, ty) point on the
 * arc: the label itself is right-anchored (position: right: 0 in the
 * CSS), so translating it by (tx, ty) directly places its inner edge
 * there.
 *
 * Every pill shares the same fixed height (see .quick-links-item-label
 * in the CSS — height + flex centering, not an intrinsic
 * content-driven height), so pills are always identical in height
 * regardless of how long each one's name is.
 *
 * HOW THE CURVE AND THE EQUAL Y-STEPS COEXIST: the vertical step is
 * still the plain constant it was before (STEP_Y) — every item's ty
 * is exactly `-STEP_Y * index`, so the height DIFFERENCE between any
 * two consecutive items is exactly STEP_Y, unchanged from before.
 * What's new is tx: instead of being placed by cumulative pill width
 * (a straight staircase), tx is now DERIVED from that same fixed ty
 * using the circle equation tx² + ty² = R², solved for tx:
 *   tx = -sqrt(R² - ty²)
 * with R set to exactly (STEP_Y * 3) — the topmost item's |ty| — so
 * item 0 (ty: 0) lands precisely at 180° and item 3 (ty: -R) lands
 * precisely at 90°, with items 1 and 2 landing wherever the circle
 * naturally puts them at their own fixed ty in between. Because the y
 * positions were fixed first and the x positions were solved to fit
 * a circle through those exact points, this produces a true curved
 * arc rather than the straight diagonal line a plain width-based
 * offset would draw between the same four y-heights. Checked against
 * the actual pill sizing in the CSS to confirm none of the 4 items
 * overlap on this curve at this radius.
 *
 * .quick-links-menu is a sibling of the trigger button, absolutely
 * positioned over the trigger's own bottom-right corner rather than
 * nested inside it — a separate layer floating above the page, the
 * same way .mobile-footer-nav is its own element rather than living
 * inside whatever button opens/closes it.
 *
 * Each item's position is expressed as CSS custom properties
 * (--qli-tx/--qli-ty, the resting offset from the trigger's corner)
 * computed once per render — so QuickLinksFab.css only needs to
 * animate a generic translate(var(--qli-tx), var(--qli-ty)) rather
 * than hardcoding four separate positions.
 *
 * Open triggers: hover (desktop/mouse) OR a click/tap.
 * Close triggers: clicking the trigger again while open, picking one
 * of the 4 buttons, the mouse leaving the whole cluster (hover-only
 * opens), or a tap outside it (click-opened, touch devices).
 *
 * A click and a hover are tracked separately (`clickOpen` / `hoverOpen`)
 * so a second *click* always closes the menu even if the cursor is
 * still hovering it — otherwise the hover state would just re-open it
 * the instant the click-close ran.
